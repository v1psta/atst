# Sample Server

## Requirements

- [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/): On macos with homebrew, `brew install nginx`
- [uwsgi](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Install.html): With python, `pip install uwsgi`.
- pipenv and honcho: If you have the regular atst dependencies installed, you already have pipenv and honcho

## Run

The sample server runs at localhost:8000, so you cannot have another copy of the app running on that port.

Start both NGINX and uWSGI with honcho:

```
pipenv run honcho start -f sample-server/Procfile
```
